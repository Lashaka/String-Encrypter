# String Encrypter/Decrypter.
This is a basic encrypter/decrypter created in Python. It uses Base64 encoding to encrypt and decrypt strings, and generates random keys if no key is provided. The graphical interface was created using the 'PySimpleGUI' library.

## Requirements
To run this encrypter/decrypter, you will need to have Python installed, as well as the following libraries:
- PySimpleGUI
- pyperclip
- base64

## Usage
1. Run main.py.
2. Enter the string you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Enter a string to encrypt or decrypt" field.
3. If you want to encrypt the string, leave the "Enter a key" field blank. If you want to decrypt a string, enter the key that was used to encrypt it in the "Enter a key" field.
4. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button, depending on what you want to do.
5. The encrypted or decrypted string will appear in the "Result" field.
6. You can copy the string or key to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy String" or "Copy Key" button.
- If you want to use your own key to encrypt a string, the key has to be generated by this app to work.

## future possible features :
- complex 'millitary grade' encryption,
- encrypting with a specific key and not random option,
- when adding a random function do not used time based rand.
