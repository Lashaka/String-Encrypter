# ON WORK. 
future features : complex 'millitary grade' encryption + encrypting with a specific key and not random

# Encrypter
This application allows two sides that own the program to communicate safely with the encrypted messages in the between
the application takes a string, gets the message through a complex encryption method, and prints the output string + key to decrypt it
