# Encrypter
App that gets message, engrypts it and gives a key, in order to decrypt enter the encrypted message and the key into this software.



get a text file / whatever file,  convert it to a global type of file, random an encryption method and implament it on the file

print the key and encrypted data




in order to retrieve the data enter key and encrypted to get decrypted



start with simple text encryption and decryption first?

do it with python

Ui with??



if i succeed make a ransomware????? :DDDD


# javascript hider
another idea for same topic is get a javascript code and convert it to 
unreadable code that still functions? could be very cool and usable! 
have a choice between fast (smaller variable name or bigger that would make code slower or faster but harder/easier to read),

MAKE USER TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS, MORE HIDING = HEAVIER CODE.

1. will use python.
2. at first need to code a way to detect all variables that can be name changed.
3. offer option to encrypt data inorder to make it even more secure.
4. consider adding bugs that javascript will ignore to improve exploiter searchers confusion.
5. option to add functions that do nothing and empty variables to add confusion
6.website will update itself with new algorithm every once in a while?



https://obfuscator.io/   this exists?? but.. no open source?   - use on my hacking website to demonstrate its use.
